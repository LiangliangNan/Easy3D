     * @brief Initialization of Easy3D.
     * @details This function initializes logging, setting, and resources. Internally it calls (and is thus identical
     *    to calling) logging::initialize(), setting::initialize(), and resource::initialize().
     *    For more fine-grained initializations, please refer to the documentation of these functions.
     * @param info_to_stdout \c true to log messages at a the \c INFO level to standard output.
     *    \c WARNING and \c ERROR (including \c FATAL) levels are always logged to standard output.
     * @param use_log_file \c True to create a ".log" file (which will be created next to the executable program).
     * @param use_setting_file \c True to create an ".ini" file (which will be created next to the executable program).
     *    This setting file stores the default rendering parameters. Users can modify this file to change the default
     *    rendering parameters, then the changes will be effective for the future.
     * @param resource_dir The resource directory containing color maps, shaders, textures, fonts, etc.
     *    \c Easy3D_RESOURCE_DIR is the default value, which is the directory coming with the Easy3D distribution.
     *    In most cases you should use the default resource directory (unless you want to use different resources).
     *
     * @sa logging::initialize(), setting::initialize(), and resource::initialize().
