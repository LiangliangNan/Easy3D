     * \brief Accurate timing of GPU operations.
     *
     * \class OpenGLTimer easy3d/renderer/opengl_timer.h
     *
     * \details Because the GPU is based on an asynchronously processed command stream that is implicitly generated
     * by OpenGL calls, it is not possible to determine the amount of time spent processing a set of OpenGL calls by
     * timing the calls themselves at the application level. Instead, the timing must be done via an asynchronous
     * timer system. This timer are started and stopped at the beginning and end of the OpenGL commands of interest.
     * However, the timings results must be queried at some point later, as the pipeline must complete before the
     * timer values are known. This class implements such a timer that behaves like a CPU timer (See StopWatch)
     *
     * Usage example:
     *      \code
     *      OpenGLTimer t;
     *      // opengl calls ...
     *      draw();
     *      fprintf(stdout, "\rTime: %2.4f ms    ", t.time());
     *      \endcode
