	/*! \brief A Frame that can be rotated and translated using the mouse.
	 * \class ManipulatedFrame easy3d/renderer/manipulated_frame.h
	 *
	 * \details A ManipulatedFrame converts the mouse motion into a translation and an orientation updates.
	 * A ManipulatedFrame is used to move an object in the scene. Combined with object selection, its MouseGrabber
	 * properties and a dynamic update of the scene, the ManipulatedFrame introduces a great reactivity in your
	 * applications.

	  A ManipulatedFrame is attached to a QGLViewer using
	  QGLViewer::setManipulatedFrame(): \code init() { setManipulatedFrame( new
	  ManipulatedFrame() ); }

	  draw()
	  {
			glPushMatrix();
			glMultMatrixd(manipulatedFrame()->matrix());
			// draw the manipulated object here
			glPopMatrix();
	  }
	  \endcode
	  See the <a href="../examples/manipulatedFrame.html">manipulatedFrame
	  example</a> for a complete application.

	  Mouse events are normally sent to the QGLViewer::camera(). You have to press
	  the QGLViewer::FRAME state key (default is \c Control) to move the
	  QGLViewer::manipulatedFrame() instead. See the <a href="../mouse.html">mouse
	  page</a> for a description of mouse button bindings.

	  <h3>Inherited functionalities</h3>

	  A ManipulatedFrame is an overloaded instance of a Frame. The powerful
	  coordinate system transformation functions (Frame::coordinatesOf(),
	  Frame::transformOf(), ...) can hence be applied to a ManipulatedFrame.

	  A ManipulatedFrame is also a MouseGrabber. If the mouse cursor gets within a
	  distance of 10 pixels from the projected position of the ManipulatedFrame, the
	  ManipulatedFrame becomes the new QGLViewer::mouseGrabber(). It can then be
	  manipulated directly, without any specific state key, object selection or GUI
	  intervention. This is very convenient to directly move some objects in the
	  scene (typically a light). See the <a
	  href="../examples/mouseGrabber.html">mouseGrabber example</a> as an
	  illustration. Note that QWidget::setMouseTracking() needs to be enabled in
	  order to use this feature (see the MouseGrabber documentation).

	  <h3>Advanced functionalities</h3>

	  A QGLViewer can handle at most one ManipulatedFrame at a time. If you want to
	  move several objects in the scene, you simply have to keep a list of the
	  different ManipulatedFrames, and to activate the right one (using
	  QGLViewer::setManipulatedFrame()) when needed. This can for instance be done
	  according to an object selection: see the <a href="../examples/luxo.html">luxo
	  example</a> for an illustration.

	  When the ManipulatedFrame is being manipulated using the mouse (mouse pressed
	  and not yet released), isManipulated() returns \c true. This might be used to
	  trigger a specific action or display (as is done with QGLViewer::fastDraw()).

	  The ManipulatedFrame also emits a manipulated() signal each time its state is
	  modified by the mouse. This signal is automatically connected to the
	  QGLViewer::update() slot when the ManipulatedFrame is attached to a viewer
	  using QGLViewer::setManipulatedFrame().*/

		of your scene, the camera may translate too fast. For a camera, it is the

		instead of changing the translationSensitivity(), solve the problem by
		(temporarily) setting the Camera::pivotPoint() to a point on the zoomed region
		(see the QGLViewer::RAP_FROM_PIXEL mouse binding in the <a
