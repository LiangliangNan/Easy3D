     * \brief A helper class for constructing manifold surface mesh models.
     * \class SurfaceMeshBuilder easy3d/core/surface_mesh_builder.h
     * \details SurfaceMeshBuilder resolves non-manifoldness while building a surface mesh.
     *      It is typically used to load a model from a file (because you don't know if the mesh is manifold or not).
     *      For meshes guaranteed to be manifold, you can also use the built-in add_vertex() and
     *      add_[face/triangle/quad]() functions of SurfaceMesh for their construction.
     * Example use:
     * \code
     *      SurfaceMeshBuilder builder(mesh);
     *      builder.begin_surface();
     *      for_each_vertex:
     *          builder.add_vertex(p);
     *      for_each_face:
     *          builder.add_face(ids); // ids: the vertices of the face
     *      builder.end_surface();
     * \endcode
