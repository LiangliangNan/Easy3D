     * \brief Implementation of a simple signal-slot mechanism.
     *        Multiple slots (a class and it member function) can be connected
     *        to a signal object.
     *        You can connect functions to the signal which will be called when
     *        the trigger() method on the signal object is invoked. Any argument
     *        passed to emit() will be passed to the given functions.
     *        A typical usage of Signal in Easy3D is camera manipulation. When
     *        the camera has been manipulated, the viewer should be notified (e.g.,
     *        a repaint event should be triggered). This is done by calling
     *        to the viewer's update() function. So in Easy3D, the viewer's update
     *        function is connected to the camera.
     * \attention Current implementation can hold only one single function of each owner.
     *            (can be easily extended to multiple ones if needed).
     * \todo Extend this class to accept non-member functions and multiple functions of a class.
