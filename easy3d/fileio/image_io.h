         * \brief Load image data from a file. The following formats are supported
         *        JPG/JPEG, PNG, BMP, PSD, TGA, GIF, HDR, PNM (.ppm and .pgm). File format is
         *        determined by the file extension given in the file name.
         *
         * \param file_name The image file to load.
         * \param data  Outputs the image data. Data will be empty if the specified image file
         *              doesn't exist, allocation failed, or the image is corrupt or invalid.
         *              The image data returned is a 1D array of 'unsigned char' which points
         *              to the pixel data, or empty when failed. The pixel data consists of
         *              'height' scanlines of 'width' pixels, with each pixel consisting of N
         *              interleaved 8-bit channels/components; the first pixel pointed to is
         *              top-left-most in the image. There is no padding between image scanlines
         *              or between pixels, regardless of format. The number of channels N is
         *              'requested_channels' if it is non-zero, or 'channels' otherwise.
         *              An output image with N components has the following components interleaved
         *              in this order in each pixel:
         *                  N=#channels     components
         *                  1               grey
         *                  2               grey, alpha
         *                  3               red, green, blue
         *                  4               red, green, blue, alpha
         *
         * \param width Outputs image width in pixels. Unchanged if failed.
         * \param height Outputs image height in pixels. Unchanged if failed.
         * \param channels Outputs the number of 8-bit image channels per pixel. Unchanged if failed.
         * \param requested_channels User requested image channels. If non-zero, force to treat the
         *                           image as if has this number of components, e.g. if you set it 4,
         *                           you will always get RGBA output, but you can check channels to
         *                           get the actual number of channels.
         * \param flip_vertically Flip the image data vertically if it is true (default value). This
         *                        is convenient for OpenGL applications where the first pixel in the
         *                        output array is expected to be the bottom left corner of the image.
         *
         * \return Return true on success or false if failed.
         *
         * Example usage:
         *      \code
         *      int width, height, channels;
         *      std::vector<unsigned char> data;
         *      bool success = ImageIO::load(data, file_name, &width, &height, &channels, 0);
         *      // ... process data if true returned ...
         *      \endcode
