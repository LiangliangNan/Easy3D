think about what Python users may needs:
 - creat/init a point cloud from a Numpy list/array
 - add/access/edit/visualize Int vertex properties (e.g., segmentation)
 - give points random color based on specified (by name) Int properties.
 - construct SrufaceMesh from vertices and indices, and show/explain the use of (and without) element buffer
 
Some planned examples:
 - put MultiView immediately after Viewer
 - Use a MultiView to show drawables: PointsDrawable (random points within a cube), TrianglesDrawable, LinesDrawable, LinesDrawable2D,
