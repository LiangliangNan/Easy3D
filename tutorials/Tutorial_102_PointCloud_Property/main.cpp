// This example shows how to
//		- add per-point properties to a point cloud;
//		- access existing properties.


int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    // Initialize logging.
    logging::initialize();

	// Initialize random number generator.
	srand(0);

	// Create a point cloud.
	PointCloud* cloud = new PointCloud;

	// Add some points. Here we add 100 points on a 10*10 grid.
	for (float i=-5; i<5; ++i) {
		for (float j = -5; j < 5; ++j) 
			cloud->add_vertex(vec3(i, j, 0));// z = 0: all points are on XY plane.
	}

	// In Easy3D, all actual 3D data and related information are stored as
	// per-element (e.g., vertex, edge, and face) properties. A model can have 
	// multiple properties and the properties can be accessed by their names. 
	// So it is important to give each property a unique name. Easy3D will pop 
	// up a warning if you attempt to create a property with an already used name.
	
	// Let's add a random color to each point. We give this property a name 
	// "v:color". Here "v:" is optional and it just indicates that this property 
	// is defined on the vertices. You will later see properties can be defined 
	// one edges (use "e:") and faces (use "f:") for surface meshes.
	PointCloud::VertexProperty<vec3> colors = cloud->add_vertex_property<vec3>("v:color");
	for (auto v : cloud->vertices())	// iterate over all vertices
		colors[v] = random_color();		// assign a random color to point 'v'

	// You can use the get_vertex_property() function to access the named properties.
	// Below I show you how to access the xyz coordinates and color of each point.
	// Here we simply print the coordinates and colors.

	// The point coordinates are stored as a per-point property 'v:point'.
	PointCloud::VertexProperty<vec3> points = cloud->get_vertex_property<vec3>("v:point");
	for (auto v : cloud->vertices())
		std::cout << "index: " << v.idx() << ", xyz: " << points[v] << ", color: " << colors[v] << std::endl;

	// delete the point cloud (i.e., release memory)
	delete cloud;
