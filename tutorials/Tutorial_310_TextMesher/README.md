TextMesher was creatd to produce the Easy3D logo. I made it a separate program in the hope that it is helpful.

TextMesher is based on [Easy3D](https://github.com/LiangliangNan/Easy3D): for triangulating the character contours, 
extruding, storing, and visualizing the mesh models.

Build TextMesher: download the entire Easy3D source code and use the CMakeList.txt in the root directory. 

Enjoy!
