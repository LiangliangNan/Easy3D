# Native Vulkan migration

The `Easy3D-Vulkan` branch starts an incremental migration. It is **not yet a
replacement for the full OpenGL renderer**. A native interactive Vulkan viewer is
now available as an opt-in host. Mapple, FigureMaker, GUI picking/effects, Python
rendering and most existing interactive tutorials still use OpenGL. They are retained until their Vulkan replacements are ready.

## Implemented

- Backend-neutral, immutable geometry and image descriptions, draw commands and
  typed color/depth/object/primitive readback in `easy3d/graphics/render_device.h`.
- A native Vulkan 1.2 offscreen device, with no OpenGL context, window, surface,
  swapchain, Qt, GLFW or GLEW dependency in the `easy3d::vulkan` target.
- Indexed/nonindexed triangle lists, plain one-pixel point/line lists, uniform and
  vertex colors, RGBA8 textures, basic directional lighting and depth testing.
- Explicit sampler descriptors, including a valid white fallback texture.
- Device-local geometry/images, staged uploads, coherent/noncoherent host memory,
  fenced submission/readback, explicit image transitions and transfer barriers.
- Independent resource realizations on multiple devices. CPU snapshots own their
  input; temporary vectors are safe. Replacing a snapshot uploads a new resource;
  expired realizations are retired after completed submissions.
- Per-device caches, transactional resource creation, resize and cleanup.
- Vulkan-to-Metal portability enumeration and the portability subset extension
  when advertised. No geometry shaders, wide-line features or private Metal API.
- Build-time GLSL450 compilation and embedded SPIR-V: installed applications need
  a Vulkan loader/driver, but no shader compiler or source-tree shader paths.
- Optional `VulkanOffScreen`, reusing Easy3D Camera, Model, Renderer and drawable
  buffer extraction, including in Vulkan-only builds with no OpenGL link dependency.
  It creates no OpenGL context and runs with `DISPLAY` unset.
- Shared drawable constructors and CPU geometry generation separated from legacy
  OpenGL uploads/drawing in `renderer/backends/opengl`. Vulkan-only builds exclude
  legacy rendering sources and shader installation entirely; GL-only entry points
  report an explicit unavailable-operation error.
- An opt-in native `VulkanViewer`/GLFW host: GPU-only swapchain presentation,
  resize/hide/show, independent windows/devices, orbit/pan/zoom, projection toggle,
  file drop and depth-based world-point picking. The installed demo uses an
  embedded bunny by default and needs no source-tree model/shader files.
- The existing Tutorial 201 compiles unchanged using the `Viewer` alias in a
  Vulkan-only window build. Legacy custom OpenGL draw callbacks are not ported.
- A new finite Tutorial 208 and deterministic Vulkan tests, including actual
  bunny mesh loading, property colors, geometry updates, snapshots and picking IDs.

## Build and run

Install the Vulkan SDK (headers, loader and `glslangValidator`). On Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libvulkan-dev mesa-vulkan-drivers glslang-tools \
    spirv-tools vulkan-validationlayers libboost-dev
```

For the complete existing build plus the experimental adapter/tutorial, also
install the usual Easy3D OpenGL/window-system dependencies, then:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-vulkan -DEasy3D_ENABLE_VULKAN=ON \
    -DEasy3D_BUILD_VULKAN_TESTS=ON -DEasy3D_VULKAN_TEST_VALIDATION=ON
cmake --build build-vulkan --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir build-vulkan --output-on-failure
./build-vulkan/bin/Tutorial_208_Vulkan_Offscreen [mesh.ply] [output.png]
```

For CPU scene APIs, `VulkanOffScreen` and the Vulkan module, with **no GL/GLEW/GLFW/ImGui build**:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-vulkan-only -DEasy3D_ENABLE_OPENGL=OFF \
    -DEasy3D_ENABLE_VULKAN_VIEWER=OFF \
    -DEasy3D_ENABLE_VULKAN=ON -DEasy3D_BUILD_TUTORIALS=OFF \
    -DEasy3D_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DEasy3D_BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS=OFF \
    -DEasy3D_ENABLE_QT=OFF -DEasy3D_BUILD_VULKAN_TESTS=ON \
    -DEasy3D_VULKAN_TEST_VALIDATION=ON
cmake --build build-vulkan-only --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir build-vulkan-only --output-on-failure
```

Validation is explicitly requested by the last option. Missing validation layers
cause tests to fail instead of silently running without validation. Leave that
option OFF for deployments without the SDK/layers. Synchronization validation
uses `VK_EXT_validation_features` from the Khronos validation layer.

For deterministic Linux software tests, set `VK_DRIVER_FILES` to the installed
lavapipe ICD JSON (often `/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/lvp_icd.x86_64.json`; distributions
use different filenames). No display server is required. This tests Vulkan
correctness, not GPU performance or macOS portability.

On macOS use a Vulkan SDK with MoltenVK and a matching loader/ICD. Follow the SDK's
runtime environment/bundling instructions. This implementation requests Vulkan
1.2 and checks target-format support. macOS and Windows hardware execution are
still required before making a cross-platform support claim.

## Interactive Vulkan window

The window host is independently opt-in. In a fresh build directory:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-vulkan-window -DEasy3D_ENABLE_VULKAN=ON \
    -DEasy3D_ENABLE_VULKAN_VIEWER=ON -DEasy3D_ENABLE_OPENGL=OFF \
    -DEasy3D_BUILD_TUTORIALS=OFF
cmake --build build-vulkan-window --parallel 4
./build-vulkan-window/bin/VulkanViewer
# Or load your own model:
./build-vulkan-window/bin/VulkanViewer path/to/model.ply
```

Use a separate build/install directory and rebuild consumers: these interfaces
remain experimental, with source compatibility for the documented subset.
GLFW's normal platform development dependencies are required (X11 or Wayland on
Linux; native Cocoa/Win32 on macOS/Windows). The host requests `GLFW_NO_API` and
never creates an OpenGL context. `Easy3D_ENABLE_OPENGL=ON` is also supported when
you want to compile the existing applications alongside the Vulkan demo.

Controls: left drag rotates, right/middle drag pans, the wheel zooms, **F** fits
all models, **P** toggles perspective/orthographic, **Escape** closes. Shift-left
click sets the camera pivot to a depth-picked surface point. You can also drop a
model file on the window. `--frames N` bounds demo execution; `--validation`
requires the Khronos and synchronization validation layers.

For C++ consumers, link `easy3d::viewer` and use:

```cpp
#include <easy3d/viewer/vulkan_viewer.h>
easy3d::VulkanViewer viewer("Mesh");
viewer.add_model("mesh.ply");
viewer.run();
```

In a Vulkan-only window build the existing `<easy3d/viewer/viewer.h>` and
`easy3d::Viewer` name select the same host. `Tutorial_201_Viewer_default` is built
unchanged in that configuration. Other tutorials are still gated until their
features and callbacks are ported; the global legacy tutorials option stays OFF.
In a dual build `Viewer` continues to select the legacy host, while
`VulkanViewer` selects Vulkan explicitly.

The host reuses Camera/Model/Renderer/Drawable and snapshot APIs from
`VulkanOffScreen`. `draw_frame()` plus `poll_events()` support an external loop;
input and pre/post-frame/resize hooks can be overridden. All native callbacks use
framebuffer-pixel coordinates, including HiDPI conversion. `point_under_pixel()`
uses the same top-left pixel convention and synchronously reads back depth on
request. Legacy GL `draw()` callbacks, overlays and full viewer shortcut parity
are not emulated. The GL-version/MSAA constructor arguments have no native
counterpart yet; use `VulkanViewerOptions`.

Create/use/destroy GLFW windows on the UI/main thread. Multiple Vulkan windows
share only GLFW lifetime, not their logical GPU devices or mutable scenes. Do not
mix these windows with the legacy GLFW Viewer in one process, whose GLFW lifetime
management is separate. A custom toolkit can supply required instance extensions
and a surface callback through `graphics::VulkanSurface`; the device owns the
returned surface and must be destroyed before its native window. Borrowed
Qt-owned VkDevices are not supported by that adapter yet.

Window tests require a display, unlike the renderer/capture tests:

```sh
ctest --test-dir build-vulkan-window --output-on-failure -LE desktop
# Linux software WSI tests (with VK_DRIVER_FILES set to lavapipe):
xvfb-run -a ctest --test-dir build-vulkan-window --output-on-failure -L desktop
```

Enable `Easy3D_BUILD_VULKAN_TESTS` and optionally
`Easy3D_VULKAN_TEST_VALIDATION` when configuring to build these tests. The Vulkan
window demo runs on the actual desktop on macOS/Windows; Xvfb is Linux-only.

## Similar existing APIs

```cpp
#include <easy3d/viewer/vulkan_offscreen.h>
#include <easy3d/core/model.h>
#include <easy3d/renderer/renderer.h>
#include <easy3d/renderer/drawable_triangles.h>

// Link easy3d::viewer from either a Vulkan-only or dual-backend build.
easy3d::VulkanOffScreen renderer(800, 600);
auto* model = renderer.add_model("bunny.ply");
if (model) {
    auto* faces = model->renderer()->get_triangles_drawable("faces");
    faces->set_uniform_coloring(easy3d::vec4(0.7f, 0.85f, 1, 1));
    renderer.camera()->showEntireScene();
    renderer.render("bunny.png");
}
```

Standalone drawables must enter CPU-buffer mode **before** their first buffer
update. Add them to `VulkanOffScreen` first, then supply geometry. Alternatively
call `drawable->enable_cpu_buffers()` before updating it. A drawable with existing
GL buffers cannot be transferred by this API; re-create it from its CPU data.
`Renderer(model, create_drawables, true)` creates CPU-backed default and subsequent
custom drawables. The default third argument remains false for existing OpenGL clients. In a
Vulkan-only build all drawables use CPU buffers automatically.

In a Vulkan-only build, the existing include `<easy3d/viewer/offscreen.h>` and
class name `easy3d::OffScreen` select this same native adapter. This preserves
common offscreen source usage without introducing a window or GL context. In a
dual build, use `VulkanOffScreen` explicitly; `OffScreen` retains its old backend.
This is source compatibility for the documented subset, not binary compatibility
or parity for GL-specific inheritance/callbacks and unsupported options.

The adapter uses the existing geometry extraction/tessellator, including polygon
faces and property coloring. Call `model->renderer()->update()` after geometry or
property changes, as before. Existing GL upload behavior stays immediate; only
explicit CPU-mode drawables retain CPU buffers. CPU mode is permanent for that
drawable. `draw(camera)`/`gl_draw()` fail explicitly in CPU mode.

For a Vulkan-only consumer, link `easy3d::vulkan`, build immutable
`graphics::Geometry`/`graphics::Image` descriptions, and submit a vector of
`graphics::DrawCommand` to `graphics::RenderDevice::render()`. See
`easy3d/graphics/tests/render_test.cpp` for a complete runnable example. The CMake
package exports the `vulkan` component and finds its Vulkan dependency.

## Current boundaries

| Area | Current behavior |
|---|---|
| Default backend | Existing Viewer/OffScreen remain OpenGL in the default/dual build. In Vulkan-only builds `OffScreen` aliases `VulkanOffScreen`; enabling the native window option also makes `Viewer` alias `VulkanViewer`. |
| `VulkanOffScreen` defaults | Opaque mesh faces; uniform or vertex/face property color; plain one-pixel points/lines. Scalar/texture properties are not automatically chosen as defaults yet. |
| Material/lighting | Basic fixed world-space diffuse term; no full material or back-face-color parity yet. Normal transforms use the inverse transpose. Disable lighting for exact unlit colors. |
| `TrianglesDrawable::opacity()` | As in the old opaque pass, effective only in a separate transparency pass; such a pass is not implemented here. |
| CPU drawable textures/scalars | Legacy `Texture` coloring is rejected. Native `graphics::Image` texturing is implemented. CPU-only implicit legacy texture creation throws before making GL calls. |
| Transparency, SSAO, shadows, EDL, text, clipping | Not ported. Do not infer support from the low-level draw-command API. The scene adapter rejects SSAO/highlighting/selection; no effect-pass interface is exposed yet. |
| Large points, spheres/surfels, cylinders/cones, wide lines | Not ported; explicit unsupported-style error from the scene adapter. |
| Snapshot options | Single sample only (default 1); MSAA and `expand=false` are rejected. Scaling, white/current/transparent background and image saving work. No tiled oversized captures. |
| Readback | RGBA8, D32 and RG32UI; top row first; depth [0,1]; no-hit object/primitive IDs are `UINT32_MAX`. |
| Picking IDs | Draw-command object ID and draw-primitive index (or explicit native primitive IDs). The adapter uses model/drawable order and generated primitive indices, not original polygon/vertex handles. Existing GUI pickers are not ported. |
| Resource scheduling | Synchronous capture/uploads and one submitted frame at a time; presentation stays on the GPU with no CPU pixel readback. Per-image presentation semaphores; queue/device idle only at swapchain recreation and destruction. Multiple frames in flight and asynchronous capture are pending. |
| Resource limits | Fixed 1,024 live texture descriptor sets; expired resources retired at the next capture. Individual allocations, not a suballocator yet. |
| Scene ownership | Like Viewer, adding a model replaces its renderer. Do not simultaneously attach the same mutable model to GL and CPU-mode hosts. Native immutable geometry can be reused across independent devices. |
| Threading | Externally synchronize device calls and model edits. CPU snapshots do not make concurrent model/property mutation safe. |
| Hosts/bindings | Native GLFW is implemented; Qt's two views, wxWidgets, ImGui and Python Vulkan integration remain pending. |
| Presentation requirements | One queue family supporting both graphics and presentation, transfer-destination surface images, RGBA/BGRA blit support, identity surface transform. Unsupported configurations fail explicitly. FIFO presentation. UNORM formats are preferred; an sRGB-only surface introduces format conversion. |

The existing OpenGL sources and shaders therefore remain necessary. Cleaning them
out now would remove working applications and tutorials. The Vulkan-only build
excludes legacy renderer/GUI/viewer implementations, GLEW and ImGui. The headless
configuration also excludes GLFW; the optional native window host includes GLFW
for window/input management. Both retain shared CPU scene APIs and the new offscreen adapter. Delete old
implementations only after each replacement passes its application/feature tests.

## Validation and remaining migration

The new CI workflow builds both Vulkan-only and dual configurations, validates
SPIR-V and renders with lavapipe and synchronization validation without X/Wayland.
It also tests native window configurations under Xvfb, including resize, multiple
devices/windows, callback failure containment and independent window lifetime.
The default existing build workflows retain their OpenGL configuration.

Local verification for this stage used Linux, GCC 14, Qt 6.8.2 and Mesa lavapipe:
Vulkan-only and dual-backend rendering tests passed with Khronos validation and
synchronization validation; the installed-package consumer rendered successfully;
SPIR-V validation passed; Vulkan-only shared libraries had no GL/GLEW/GLFW/Qt
linkage or imported GL calls. The enabled legacy tutorials, FigureMaker and Mapple
compiled, and all 34 automated legacy test groups passed under Xvfb. This does not
validate native macOS/Windows execution, interactive Qt behavior, or Python
rendering on Vulkan. The new GitHub workflow is added but has not been run on
GitHub as part of this local work.

The native-window stage additionally passed headless and Xvfb presentation tests
with synchronization validation, including live window-image inspection. Tutorial
201 builds unchanged through the native Viewer alias. Installed-resource
validation no longer requires legacy GL shaders in Vulkan-only packages.

Next implementation gates are native Qt/wx surface/frame adapters, portable
impostors, text and texture/scalar state, ID mapping/pickers, MSAA and capture,
effects/transparency, all applications/tutorials and Python integration, then
hardware validation and packaging on macOS/Windows/Linux. Switching defaults and
removing the remaining OpenGL code depends on these gates.
