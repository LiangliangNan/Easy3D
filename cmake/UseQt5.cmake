# This file sets up Qt5 for CMake. When Qt5 was setup successfuly, QT5_FOUND
# will be set.
#
# To use QT5_FOUND, you only need to include this file and specifying Qt libraries
# to link against, e.g.,
#       ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#           project(${PROJECT_NAME})
#           include( ../../cmake/UseQt5.cmake )
#           add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME}, main.cpp)
#           target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} Qt5::Core Qt5::Gui Qt5::Widgets Qt5::OpenGL)
#       ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE: 'UseQt5.cmake' must be included after you define your project but before
#       'add_executable()' or'add_library()'.
#
#   The recommended way to specify libraries and headers with CMake is to use the
#   target_link_libraries command. This command automatically adds appropriate
#   include directories, compile definitions, the position-independent-code flag,
#   and links to the qtmain.lib library on Windows.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
